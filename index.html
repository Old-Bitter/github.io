            <h4>Week One - July 11th, 2025</h4>
            <p>I guess I'll just make this a personal log of what I'm learning about. I'm taking <em>Using SQL & SQL Server</em>, <em>Intro to Software Development</em>, and <em>Intro to Programming</em> this summer. I'm hoping to use this to practice and display what I learn from those classes here.</p>

            <h4>Week One - July 9th, 2025</h4>
            <p>This is my simple website for week one. I haven't made one of these in well over a decade.</p>
